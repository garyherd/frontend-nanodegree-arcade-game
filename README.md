# Frogger Clone

This is a slimmed-down version of the classic '80's arcade game

## Installation
Clone this project to your machine

`$ git clone https://github.com/garyherd/front-end-nanodegree-arcade-game.git`

## Running the game
To start the game, open the index.html file in your browser. The objective is to get your character safely to the top of the screen. The game ends if your character collides with the moving bugs. There are four valid keys for moving the character:
* Up arrow
* Down arrow
* Left arrow
* Right arrow

If you win or lose, the game resets with the player at the bottom of the screen. The game runs continuously until you close the page.
