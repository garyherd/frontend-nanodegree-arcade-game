===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# Frogger Clone

This is a slimmed-down version of the classic '80's arcade game

## Installation
Clone this project to your machine

`$ git clone https://github.com/garyherd/front-end-nanodegree-arcade-game.git`

## Running the game
To start the game, open the index.html file in your browser. The objective is to get your character safely to the top of the screen. The game ends if your character collides with the moving bugs. There are four valid keys for moving the character:
* Up arrow
* Down arrow
* Left arrow
* Right arrow
